# Random Password Generator  

This simple Python script generates a random password using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.  

## How It Works  
1. The script prompts the user to enter the desired password length.  
2. It randomly selects characters from a predefined set of all keyboard symbols.  
3. The generated password is displayed to the user.  

## Usage  
Run the script and enter a number when prompted:  

```
Enter the length of your password: 12
Your random password is: G7@b&X2m!Qk
```

## Requirements  
- Python 3.x  
- No additional libraries required (uses the built-in `random` module).
